## Description
Imagine feeling bored while playing chess with your friends. You’re ready for a fresh challenge that goes beyond the usual moves. That’s where our project comes in. We’re developing a chess program that not only plays on its own but also offers an engaging experience for players of all levels. Our first step is ensuring the program can make valid chess moves, like teaching it the basics of chess strategy. Once it masters the basics, we’ll focus on making it smarter, aiming to win games against human opponents. Beyond functionality, we want our program to be user-friendly. Imagine an intuitive interface that works seamlessly on different devices. Whether you’re alone or challenging friends, our chess program adapts to various devices, allowing you to enjoy the game wherever you are.
