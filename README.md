## Proposal :thought_balloon:
Imagine feeling bored while playing chess with your friends. You’re ready for a fresh challenge that goes beyond the usual moves. That’s where our project comes in. We’re developing a chess program that not only plays on its own but also offers an engaging experience for players of all levels. Our first step is ensuring the program can make valid chess moves, like teaching it the basics of chess strategy. Once it masters the basics, we’ll focus on making it smarter, aiming to win games against human opponents. Beyond functionality, we want our program to be user-friendly. Imagine an intuitive interface that works seamlessly on different devices. Whether you’re alone or challenging friends, our chess program adapts to various devices, allowing you to enjoy the game wherever you are.

## General Requeriments :memo:

* User-friendly interface: having an intuitive interface with the board in the middle and a simple buttons layout will attract more users:
  * Highlighting possible moves for all pieces.
  * Suggesting plays after some time without moving a piece.
  * Visual feedback after valid or invalid moves.
* Multiplatform: Making it a web app, our program will be compatible with the principal platforms such as Windows, Linux and Mac OS and mobile devices.
* Customization options: It will be possible to personalize the board or the pieces at the game. In PvC (Person vs Computer) it will be possible to change difficulty.
* Online multiplayer: The game will allow players to challenge each other, regardless of their location.
* Tutorial and contextual help: Include an interactive tutorial and provide contextual help within the game to guide new players and help them understand the rules and strategies of chess. This will improve the user experience and make it easier for beginners to dive into the game.
* Able to choose the best move based on previous movement by Minimax: Implementing Minimax algorithm to select the best move is a desirable feature that will improve the game quality and provide a more significant challenge for players. This demonstrates a focus on artificial intelligence and continuous improvement of the program.
* Planning precision movements for different difficulties by choosing not the best or worse min-max case: The ability to adjust the game difficulty by selecting precise movements based on the player's skill level is a valuable feature that will enhance the gaming experience and provide appropriate challenges for players of different skill levels.
